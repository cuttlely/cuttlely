# Docs screenshots

Reshoots the pictures for the canvas, share and embed, the API and Try the demo.

```bash
pnpm build
bash scripts/setup-hermes.sh
node scripts/docs-shots/capture.mjs
```

The script starts a fresh server on an empty data directory, signs in with the local owner account, and takes the pictures with Playwright at browser zoom 100%. It does not sign in to an outside service.

Set `DOCS_SHOT_USE_EXTERNAL=1` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to answer with that key. With the variable unset, a loopback stand-in answers so the pictures stay on made-up bakery and customer-care text and do not show a currency amount. The key is read from the environment only. The script never prints it, and no picture shows a key, a token or a masked prefix.

`DOCS_SHOTS=canvas,share,api,demo,demo-chart,card` limits the set. `demo-chart` reshoots only the bakery March croissant answer. `all` is the default.
